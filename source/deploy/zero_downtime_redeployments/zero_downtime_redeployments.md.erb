<h1>Zero-downtime application updates and restarts<br>
<small>for <%= language_name %> apps on Passenger <%= integration_mode_name_as_passenger_suffix %></small></h1>

Passenger has excellent support for zero-downtime application updates and restarts in its [Enterprise edition](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/enterprise).

Normally, when you instruct Passenger to [restart an application](<%= url_for "/admin/nginx/restart_app.html" %>) after you have deployed an application update, Passenger performs a _blocking restart_. Passenger would shut down all processes for that application and spawn a new one. The spawning of a new application process could take a while, and any requests that come in during this time will be blocked until this first application process has spawned, which users may experience as "downtime".

If your organization follows an agile development methology then you will want to deploy application updates very often. Github is reported deploy updates six times per day. Deploying updates quickly means that you receive feedback about them more quickly, which aids with the development process. The more often you deploy, the less desirable blocking restarts are.

To solve this problem, Passenger Enterprise provides zero-downtime restarts, also known as "rolling restarts". This mechanism prevents visitors from experiencing any delays when you are restarting your application.

## How it works

A zero-downtime restart works as follows:

 1. Passenger Enterprise spawns a new process in the background.
 2. When it's done spawning, Passenger Enterprise will replace one of the old processes with this newly spawned one.
 3. Step 1 and 2 are repeated until all processes have been replaced.

There are other methods to perform a zero-downtime restart. Some application servers spawn as many processes as currently exist, then reroute all traffic to that set of newly spawned processes, then shutdown the old processes. The disadvantage of this approach is that it temporarily requires twice as much memory. For this reason, we have chosen not to use that approach with Passenger Enterprise. Passenger Enterprise's approach is more resource friendly.

### Caveats

Zero-downtime restarts have a few caveat however that you should be aware of:

 * Upgrading an application sometimes involves upgrading the database schema. With zero-downtime restarts, there may be a point in time during which processes belonging to the previous version and processes belonging to the new version both exist at the same time. Any database schema upgrades you perform must therefore be backwards-compatible with the old application version.
 * Because there's no telling which process will serve a request, users may not see changes brought about by the new version until all processes have been restarted. It is for this reason that you should not use rolling restarts in development, only in production.

## Enabling zero-downtime restarts

Passenger provides [several ways to restart your application](<%= url_for "/admin/nginx/restart_app.html" %>). Each way has its own mechanism for enabling zero-downtime restarts.

passenger-config restart-app

: If you use `passenger-config restart-app` to restart your application, then pass the `--rolling-restart` command line argument.

restart.txt

: If you use `restart.txt` to restart your application, then enable the
<% if integration_mode_type == :nginx %>
  [passenger_rolling_restarts on](<%= url_for "/config/nginx/reference/index.html" %>#passenger_rolling_restarts) configuration option.
<% elsif integration_mode_type == :apache %>
  [PassengerRollingRestarts on](<%= url_for "/config/apache/reference/index.html" %>#passengerrollingrestarts) configuration option.
<% elsif integration_mode_type == :standalone %>
  [`--rolling-restarts` / "rolling_restarts"](<%= url_for "/config/standalone/reference/index.html" %>#--rolling-restarts-rolling_restarts) configuration option.
<% else %>
  <% raise "TODO" %>
<% end %>

<% if integration_mode_type == :nginx || integration_mode_type == :apache %>
Restarting <%= integration_mode_name %>

: Normally, Passenger restarts all your applications when you restart <%= integration_mode_name %>. If you want to prevent this from happening, please use the [Flying Passenger](<%= url_for "/deploy/#{integration_mode_type}/flying_passenger.html" %>) feature.

    If you followed the <a href="<%= url_for "/deploy/#{integration_mode_type}/automating_app_updates/#{language_type}/index.html" %>">Automating deployments of application updates</a> guide, and you want to enable zero-downtime restarts in Capistrano, then here's how you can do that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Open <code>config/deploy.rb</code> and ensure that <code>--rolling-restart</code> is set in the <code>passenger_restart_options</code> setting:
  </p>
  <pre class="highlight"><span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:passenger_restart_options</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">deploy_to</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> --ignore-app-not-running --rolling-restart"</span> <span class="p">}</span></pre>
<% else %>
  <h3 id="automation">Automation scripts</h3>

    If you followed the <a href="<%= url_for "/deploy/#{integration_mode_type}/automating_app_updates/#{language_type}/index.html" %>">Automating deployments of application updates</a> guide, and you want to enable zero-downtime restarts there, then here's how you can do that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Open <code>deploy/work.sh</code> and look for this line:
  </p>
  <pre class="highlight">RESTART_ARGS=</pre>
  <p>
    Change it to:
  </p>
  <pre class="highlight">RESTART_ARGS=--rolling-restart</pre>
<% end %>
</div>

## Tracking rolling restart progress

You can track the progress of rolling restarts using [passenger-status](<%= url_for "/admin/#{integration_mode_type}/overall_status_report.html" %>). That tool will tell you which processes are already rolling restarted, which processes haven't been rolling restarted, and which process is currently being rolling restarted.

Here is an example:

<div>
  <pre class="highlight"><span class="prompt">$ </span>sudo passenger-status
<span class="output">Version : 5.0.13
Date    : 2015-07-06 12:18:38 +0200
Instance: bdVuBLEf (nginx/1.8.0 Phusion_Passenger/5.0.13)

----------- General information -----------
Max pool size : 9
App groups    : 1
Processes     : 2

    CPU: 0%      Memory  : 60M     Last used: 4s ago
  * PID: 18334   Sessions: 0       Processed: 2873    Uptime: 5h 53m 26s
    CPU: 0%      Memory  : 96M     Last used: 29s ago

  * PID: 18339   Sessions: 0       Processed: 2873    Uptime: 5h 53m 26s
    CPU: 0%      Memory  : 96M     Last used: 29s ago</span></pre>
</div>

The "Rolling restarting..." indicator tells you which process is currently being rolling restarted.

Processes that have already been rolling restarted have a low uptime. In this example, you can see that process 29843 has an uptime of 14 seconds, which is evidence that it has recently been rolling restarted.

Processes that have not yet been rolling restarted have a high uptime. Process 18339 in this example has not yet been rolling restarted.

## Deployment error resistance

A related feature is [deployment error resistance](<%= url_for "/deploy/#{integration_mode_type}/deployment_error_resistance.html" %>). This feature reduces the chance of visitors experiencing any errors in case the deployment of an application update failed. If you use zero-downtime restarts, then we.

## Error handling and troubleshooting

If Passenger Enterprise could not rolling restart a process (let's call it 'A') because it is unable to spawn a new process (let's call it 'B'), then Passenger Enterprise will give up trying to rolling restart that particular process 'A'. What happens next depends on whether [deployment error resistance](<%= url_for "/deploy/#{integration_mode_type}/deployment_error_resistance.html" %>) is enabled:

 * If deployment error resistance is disabled (the default), then Passenger Enterprise will proceed with trying to restart the remaining processes.
 * If deployment error resistance is enabled, the Passenger Enterprise will give up rolling restarting immediately. The application group will be put into Deployment Error Resistance Mode.

In any case, all errors encountered during a rolling restart process are [logged](<%= url_for "/admin/#{integration_mode_type}/log_file.html" %>). If you suspect that something is wrong, please read the log file.
