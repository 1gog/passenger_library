# Automating deployments of application updates

If you have followed the [deployment walkthrough](../walkthroughs/deploy/), then you know that deploying application updates takes multiple steps. Performing all these steps every time you want to deploy application updates is time-consuming and error-prone. This guide teaches you how to automate the deployment of application updates.

Please select your programming language:

 * [**Ruby**: automation with Capistrano](ruby_capistrano.html)
 * [**Python**: automation with shell scripts](automating_deployment_python_app_updates_with_shell_scripts.html)
 * [**Node.js and io.js**: automation with shell scripts](automating_deployment_nodejs_app_updates_with_shell_scripts.html)
