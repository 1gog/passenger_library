### passenger_root

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">

Refers to the location to the Passenger root directory, or to a location configuration file. This configuration option is essential to Passenger, and allows Passenger to locate its own data files.

You normally do not need to set this configuration option. If you used our [Debian](<%= url_for "/install/nginx/apt_repo.html" %>) or [RPM](<%= url_for "/install/nginx/yum_repo.html" %>) packages to [install Passenger](<%= url_for "/install/nginx/install/index.html" %>), then they automatically configure `passenger_root` for you with the right value. If you installed Passenger from Homebrew, tarball or RubyGems, then at some point during the installation process you are told what the correct value should be, and instructed to insert it into your Nginx configuration file.

#### What happens if this option is not set, or set wrongly

If you do not set `passenger_root`, Passenger will disable itself, and Nginx will behave as if Passenger was never installed.

If you set `passenger_root` to the wrong value, then Passenger will attempt to locate some of its own files, fail to do so, then complain with an error message and abort Nginx.

#### How to fix passenger_root

If you lost the `passenger_root` configuration value (e.g. because you accidentally removed the Nginx configuration file, and you are trying to reconstruct it), if you didn't follow the installation instructions correctly, or if you [moved Passenger to a different directory](<%= url_for "/install/nginx/moving.html" %>), then you can fix `passenger_root` as follows.

The correct value for `passenger_root` can be obtained as follows:

 * If you installed Passenger through source tarball or by cloning it from the Passenger Github repository, then the value should be the path to the Passenger directory.
 * In all other cases, obtain the correct value by running the following command:

       passenger-config --root

Once you have obtained the value, open your Nginx configuration file and insert a `passenger_root` option somewhere with that value.


## Deployment options

### passenger_enabled

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_enabled <em>on|off</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>passenger_enabled off;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>2.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This option enables or disables Passenger for that particular context. Passenger is disabled by default, so you must explicitly enable it for contexts where you want Passenger to serve your application. Please see [the deployment guide](<%= url_for "/deploy/nginx/index.html" %>) for full examples.

~~~nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.example.com;
    root /webapps/example/public;

    # You must explicitly set 'passenger_enabled on', otherwise
    # Phusion Passenger won't serve this app.
    passenger_enabled on;
}
~~~

Note that since version 5.0.0, `passenger_enabled` is inherited into subcontexts. This was not the case in previous versions.


### passenger_base_uri

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_base_uri <em>uri</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>2.0.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<!-- TODO: fix link -->
Used to specify that the given URI is an distinct application that should be served by Passenger. Please see [the deployment guide](<%= url_for "/deploy/nginx/index.html" %>) for more information.

It is allowed to specify this option multiple times. Do this to deploy multiple applications in different sub-URIs under the same virtual host.


### passenger_document_root

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th>
    <td>passenger_document_root <em>path</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Since</th>
    <td>4.0.25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Context</th>
    <td>http, server, location, if</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<!-- TODO: fix link -->
Used in sub-URI deployment scenarios to tell Passenger where it should look for static files. Please see [the deployment guide](<%= url_for "/deploy/nginx/index.html" %>) for more information.
