# Phusion Passenger APT repository

We provide APT repositories for installing Phusion Passenger on Debian and Ubuntu systems. There are separate repositories for the open source and Enterprise versions.

These APT repositories contain Passenger packages for multiple versions of Debian and Ubuntu. These packages are automatically built by our build server after we push out a source release, and thus are always up to date with the official source releases.

If you use these packages to install Passenger then you do not need to run `passenger-install-apache2-module` or `passenger-install-nginx-module`. These packages contain all the binaries that you need.

Packages are available for the x86 and x86_64 architectures. Our policy is to support all Ubuntu LTS releases that are still supported by Canonical, plus the latest Ubuntu release, plus all Debian releases that are still supported by Debian.

To learn more about installing Passenger or Passenger Enterprise through APT, please refer to one of the installation guides. When asked to select an operating system, select <strong>"Debian, Ubuntu"</strong>.
