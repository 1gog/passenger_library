<h1>Upgrading <%= edition_title %> <%= integration_mode_name_as_passenger_suffix %></h1>

<p class="lead">How to upgrade <%= edition_title %> <%= integration_mode_name_as_passenger_suffix %> depends on how <%= edition_title %> was installed. Please select the option most relevant to you.</p>

<% end %>

## Debian packages (Debian, Ubuntu)

If <%= edition_title %> was installed through the Phusion Passenger [APT repository](<%= url_for "/install/#{integration_mode_type}/apt_repo/index.html" %>), then you can upgrade <%= edition_title %>
<% if integration_mode_type != :standalone -%>
  along with <%= integration_mode_name %>
<% end -%>
through APT using the following command:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade

<h3 class="notoc">Don't see any updates?</h3>

If you don't see any updates, then there are two possible reasons:

 1. Our Debian packages haven't been released yet. When we release a new version of <%= edition_title %>, it typically takes 1-2 hours for our server to build Debian packages.
 2. If you are using a non-Long Term Support version of Ubuntu, then it is possible that we have [dropped support for that Ubuntu version](<%= url_for "/install/#{integration_mode_type}/apt_repo/index.html" %>#limited-package-support-for-non-lts-ubuntu-versions).

## RPM packages (Red Hat, CentOS)

If <%= edition_title %> was installed through the Phusion Passenger [YUM repository](<%= url_for "/install/#{integration_mode_type}/yum_repo/index.html" %>), then you can upgrade <%= edition_title %>
<% if integration_mode_type != :standalone -%>
  along with <%= integration_mode_name %>
<% end -%>
through YUM using the following command:

    sudo yum update

<h3 class="notoc">Don't see any updates?</h3>

If you don't see any updates, then maybe our RPM packages haven't been released yet. When we release a new version of <%= edition_title %>, it typically takes 2-3 hours for our server to build RPM packages.

## Heroku

If you are using <%= edition_title %> on Heroku, then update the `<%= gem_name %>` by running:

    bundle update <%= gem_name %>

Then commit and push to Heroku:

    git commit -a -m "Upgrade <%= edition_title %> to latest version"
    git push heroku master

## Docker

Please refer to [the passenger-docker website](https://github.com/phusion/passenger-docker#upgrading_passenger) for upgrade instructions.

## Source tarball

If <%= edition_title %> was installed through a source tarball, then please follow the [source tarball upgrade guide](tarball_upgrade.html).

<% if integration_mode_type == :standalone %>
  <!-- ****** Ruby gemfile ****** -->
  <h2 id="gemfile">Ruby Gemfile</h2>

  <div class="note">Are you using Heroku? Please read the <a href="#heroku">Heroku upgrade instructions instead.</a></div>

  <p>If you are using <%= edition_title %> Standalone, and at the same time you have "<%= gem_name %>" as an entry in your Gemfile, then you can upgrade <%= edition_title %> by running:</p>

  <pre class="highlight">bundle update <%= gem_name %></pre>
<% end %>

## RubyGems<%= " (but not through Gemfile)" if integration_mode_type == :standalone %>

<% if integration_mode_type == :standalone -%>
If Passenger was installed through RubyGems (but not through [Gemfile](#gemfile)),
<% else -%>
If Passenger was installed through RubyGems,
<% end -%>
then upgrading Passenger involves going through the normal installation process again. Please follow the installation guide that is most relevant to you:

 * [Installation guide with RVM](<%= url_for "/install/#{integration_mode_type}/install/#{edition_type}/rubygems_rvm/index.html" %>)
 * [Installation guide without RVM](<%= url_for "/install/#{integration_mode_type}/install/#{edition_type}/rubygems_norvm/index.html" %>)

Please *ignore the warning* there that tells you that the guide is not for updates.

<% if integration_mode_type == :apache %>
  When done, please don't forget to update the Apache configuration snippet that the installer tells you about at the end.
<% elsif integration_mode_type == :nginx %>
  Be sure to install Nginx into the same prefix that you previously installed Nginx to.

  When done, please don't forget to update the Nginx configuration snippet that the installer tells you about at the end.
<% end %>
