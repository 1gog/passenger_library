### Upon accessing the web app, Nginx reports a "Permission denied" error

#### Symptoms

A typical error message looks like this:

~~~
2013/10/21 17:16:03 [alert] 98687#0: *1 Cannot stat
'/Users/phusion/Sites/rack.test/config.ru': Permission denied (errno=13); This
error means that the Nginx worker process (PID 99064, running as UID 70) does
not have permission to access this file. Please read the manual to learn how to
fix this problem: section 'Troubleshooting' -> 'Upon accessing the web app,
Nginx reports a "Permission denied" error'; Extra info, client: 127.0.0.1,
server: www.foo.com, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", host: "www.foo.com"
~~~

#### Cause

Passenger tries to access your application directory in order to find out what language it's written in. This access is initiated from inside an Nginx worker process. This error indicates that the Nginx worker process does not have the proper permissions to access your application's root directory.

#### Solution

You need to relax permissions to that the Nginx worker process can access your application directory, by making the directory group- and world-*executable*:

~~~bash
sudo chmod g+x,o+x /Users/phusion/Sites/rack.test
~~~

You *also* need to ensure that all parent directories are also 'executable' by the Nginx process:

~~~bash
sudo chmod g+x,o+x /Users/phusion/Sites
sudo chmod g+x,o+x /Users/phusion
sudo chmod g+x,o+x /Users
~~~

<div class="note">
  <strong>Why 'executable' permission and not 'readable'?</strong>
  <p>
    On Unix, the 'executable' permission on directories dictates whether a process is allowed to <em>access</em> files or subdirectories within that directory. The 'readable' permission dictates whether a process is allowed to see what files are inside the directory, but does not necessarily allow access to them. You can learn more at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Permissions">Wikipedia</a>.
