[Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) is an open source **web application server** for <%= language_name %>. It handles HTTP requests, manages processes and resources, and enables administration, monitoring and problem diagnosis. Passenger is very easy to use, makes deploying in production much easier and is scalable.

This walkthrough teaches you step-by-step how to install <%= language_name %> and Passenger in a production environment,
<% if infrastructure == :heroku %>
on Heroku.
<% else %>
on a Linux/Unix server that you control.
<% end %>

This walkthrough is also applicable if you are using [Passenger Enterprise](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/enterprise).

### Is this walkthrough right for you?

Not familiar with Passenger, or looking to run Passenger in a development environment instead? Then please take a look at the [quickstart](<%= url_for '/walkthroughs/start/index.html' %>) and the [basics walkthrough](<%= url_for '/walkthroughs/basics/index.html' %>).

<% if infrastructure == :ownserver %>
This walkthrough is infrastructure-neutral. That means that you can follow this walkthrough on almost any hosting provider or infrastructure. However, we also have [walkthroughs for specific infrastructures](<%= url_for "/walkthroughs/deploy/#{language_type}/index.html" %>)
<% if language_type == :ruby -%>
-- e.g. [Heroku](<%= url_for "/walkthroughs/deploy/#{language_type}/heroku/index.html" %>) --
<% end -%>
that may be friendlier. Please [take a look](<%= url_for "/walkthroughs/deploy/#{language_type}/index.html" %>) and see whether we have a specific walkthrough for the infrastructure that you are on.
