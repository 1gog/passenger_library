<h1>Deploying a <%= language_name %> app with Passenger to production</h1>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/">Passenger</a> is an open source <strong>web application server</strong> for <%= language_name %>. It handles HTTP requests, manages processes and resources, and enables administration, monitoring and problem diagnosis. Passenger is very easy to use, makes deploying in production much easier and is scalable.
</p>

<p>
  This walkthrough teaches you step-by-step how to install <%= language_name %> and Passenger in a production environment. This walkthrough is also applicable if you are using <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/enterprise">Passenger Enterprise</a>.
</p>

<p>
  A few things you should be aware of first:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Not familiar with Passenger, or looking to run Passenger in a development environment instead? Then please take a look at the <a href="<%= url_for "/walkthroughs/start/#{language_type}.html" %>">quickstart</a> and the <a href="<%= url_for "/walkthroughs/basics/#{language_type}/index.html" %>">basics walkthrough</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    This walkthrough assumes that you are deploying <a href="<%= url_for("/walkthroughs/start/#{language_type}.html") %>#preparing-the-example-application">the example app from the quickstart</a>. If you are following this walkthrough to deploy your own app, then please be aware that it may not work 100% because your app may have custom dependencies or other requirements that this walkthrough can't take account of.
  </li>
</ul>
