# Integration modes

As explained in [the basics walkthrough](<%= url_for '/walkthroughs/basics/index.html' %>), Passenger collaborates with other components. This is why Passenger supports multiple *integration modes*. Each integration mode is designed for easy collaboration with a different component.

During development, you will usually want to use the Standalone mode because it's the most convenient in that context. But in production you may want to think about which integration mode to pick.
